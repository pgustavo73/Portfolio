I found an excellent tutorial on YouTube made by Chirag Kachhadiya. But was entirely in Java. Then I challenged myself to follow this tutorial. And bring everything to Kotlin. I also made some improvements. We can edit messages, delete them, and send pictures. And we can zoom in and zoom out with finger pincers and download these pictures.
